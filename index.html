        <p id="aBitMoreAbout" class="about wow flipInY">I was born on the 7th of July 2004. I started school at the age three at Wharf in Surrey. I don't remeber anything from back then beacause it was a long, long time ago. To be honest, I don't remeber anything from the first school I went to. At the age of six I moved to West Drayton (where I am currently living) and joined Cherry Lane Primary School. It was just like any normal primary school to be honest, did a few plays(of which, I absolutley hated performing in), school trips(I loved school trips), you know, the regular stuff you would expect to do in a school. After four years at Cherry Lane, I was at the end of year 6. I had never missed a day off, they gave me Kindle tablet as a reward. After that, our school had a six weeks holiday, before everyone moves to the next academic year. In the holidays I didn't really do anything that important, just the usual stuff, football, videogames. After that I started at secondary school. I went to Stockley Academy for secondary school. It was just like any normal secondary school. Nothing happend in the first year. I have just recently finished the first 6 weeks of my second year at Stockley Academy. Nothing interesting has happend.
